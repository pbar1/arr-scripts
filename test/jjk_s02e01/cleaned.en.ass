Dialogue: 10,0:09:43.07,0:09:45.24,Default,Utahime,0,0,0,,If my patching theory is correct,
Dialogue: 10,0:09:45.24,0:09:51.21,Default,Utahime,0,0,0,,running in opposite directions would make it harder\N for the curse to hold the barrier together.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:51.21,0:09:54.21,Default,Utahime,0,0,0,,Once we have an opening, we might be able to escape!
